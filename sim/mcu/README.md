The PIC32CX SG41 series is either a re-badged SAM4E or at least based on the
SAM4E series, so the IBIS files for the old SAM parts are used.  I couldn't
find these on the Microchip website now, let alone those for the new PIC32CX
so these IBIS files were copied from an archive downloaded from the Microchip
website a few years ago for an old project based on the SAM4E.
