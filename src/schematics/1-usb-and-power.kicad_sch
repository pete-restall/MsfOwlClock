  (text "TODO: Whilst the device will _support_ USB Suspend, it cannot actually achieve the 2.5mA limit - the DPS1133 voltage monitor / switch will draw a minimum of 1.5mA quiescent.\nWhat we can do - which seems to be compliant - is to issue a RESUME after 5ms of inactivity (3ms of inactivity triggers the SUSPEND).  This is remote wake-up.  It's not a particularly\ngood thing to do since it requires hubs that are otherwise globally suspended to wake up, increasing power consumption across the entire bus.  This isn't really in the spirit of the\nrule so maybe make the RESUME an optional flag that can be toggled by the user, even though the device will draw more than 2.5mA in strict contravention of the standard.  But that way\nat least we won't be forcing bus up-down-up-down cycles and we can still achieve something close to the 2.5mA."
